# Arduino-Unity-SysEx-Blob-Bridge
This pair of scripts exchanges binary blobs between Unity and Arduino  via MIDI-Compatible SysEx messages.

By using Sysex signaling the stream is 'invisible' to other devices in the chain, yet is binary safe.

While this can be used as a more general serialisation mechanism, here implemented in a most simple possible manner, the use case here is to be used as a way to write a Unity-Based setup edtior for a devide that's Arduino based.

There's countless ways to achieve this, but here the constraint was that I want the MIDI sequencer I am building to remain functional, as in send and recieve normal MIDI messages, and don't disrupt other MIDI devices in the chain.

MIDI is a serial, one to one, unidirectional protocol, compatible with RS232 in terms of logical levels (as long as you force it to non-standard baud of 31250). Its not quite compatible electrically though as you need a transoptor on the input stage, and be prepared to drive such isolator on the output stage. 

 Arduino, which is a single USART microcontroller, cannot operate two bauds at the same time, so while MIDI Connection is required, you cannot communicate with the device via USB
 
 Normally, transmission is simple

MIDI is unidirectional, but you can make loops, so you can get your signal back even after going through a few hops
